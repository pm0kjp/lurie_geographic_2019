# Lurie Advancing Analytics for Children's Hospitals

You want to check out [the R Markdown script for the webinar](Scripts/geojson_leaflet.Rmd) and [the rendered html (you'll want to download and open it)](Scripts/geojson_leaflet.html).

What are our goals?

* Understand what's inside objects imported by `rgdal` (R Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)
* Be able to make dynamic maps using `leaflet`
* Combine data to come up with useful visualizations

--------

## Scripts

Scripts are provided as R Markdown documents and should knit without problems as they pull data from online sources.  In the case of unforeseen problems (a federal government shutdown, connectivity problems), versions of these data are also saved in the [Data](/Data) portion of this repo.
