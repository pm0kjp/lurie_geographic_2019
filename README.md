__ODSC East 2019 Warm Up Webinar Participants:__

You want to check out [the script for the webinar](Scripts/WebinarSneakPeek.Rmd) and [the rendered html (you'll want to download and open it)](Scripts/WebinarSneakPeek.html).

What are our goals?

* Understand what's inside objects imported by `rgdal` (R Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)
* Be able to make dynamic maps using `leaflet`
* Combine data to come up with useful visualizations

Workshop materials for the "Mapping Geographic Data in R" workshop given by Joy Payton as part of ODSC East, held in Boston in spring 2019

## Scripts

Scripts are provided as R Markdown documents and should knit without problems as they pull data from online sources.  In the case of unforeseen problems (a federal government shutdown, connectivity problems), versions of these data are also saved in the [Data](/Data) portion of this repo.
